### Autofill Options

![Autofill Tool](.gitbook/assets/autofill_option_breakdown.png)

This is comprised of three \(3\) parts.

* 1 Autofill **text input area**. \(purple background\)
* 2 **Autofill tag** that will replace text.
* 3 **Delete autofill** entry.

### Text Input Area

The text that should get replaced by the related autofill tag.

_**Special Interactions**_

Because some dealer's like to use different text for things.

* e.g. INFINITI of Tampa, could also be
  * Tampa INFINITI
  * INFINITI Tampa
* So to account for this, you can adjust the 'text to be replaced' and add all possible variations to the area.
* You can separate the variations by using " ; " \(semi-colon\)

#### Lets do a quick demo shall we?

Using the text mentioned above. I want to replace anything related to the dealer's name with the autofill tag %DEALER\_NAME%. So I write this text into the autofill text area.

```text
Tanaka Motors;Tanaka of Tokyo
```

When you click the 'Magic' button the tool will break down the text if it sees ; and start its search.

* round 1 = Tanaka Motors
* round 2 = Tanaka of Tokyo
