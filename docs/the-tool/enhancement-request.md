# Enhancement Request

![Enhancement Request Button](../.gitbook/assets/enhancement.jpg)

While using the tool, have you ever thought that it would be awesome if it also did this!? Or maybe it would be great if the tool could also work with this?! Well please don't be shy and share your idea. Odds are that if you think it would be good idea to have this feature, other people might have as well. And if they haven't, well then you could introduce them to a new way of using the tool! =\]

Clicking this button will open a new tab leading to the [GitHub ](https://github.com/cirept/autofillReplacer/issues/new?template=feature_request.md)at the starting page for requesting a new enhancement for this tool.
