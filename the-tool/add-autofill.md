# Add Autofill

Clicking this will display a drop down list of all the current autofill tags available in our sites.  Once the pop up can be viewed, simply click on the autofill you would like to add to the list and it will get added.  

### Why are the options grey'd out?

Autofill tags that have already been configured will be disabled. \(Depicted in grey in the screenshot\).  There isn't a need to have duplicate autofills since multiple words can be added into an autofill entry and separated with a semi-colon ";" to match and replace different words or phrases.
